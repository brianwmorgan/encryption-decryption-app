## Frontend - How the App Works
### Dashboard
The **Dashboard** page serves as the homepage for the app. The navigation bar includes links to the **Dashboard**, **Search**, **New Reservation**, and **New Table** pages. A user can toggle between different dates by clicking the **Previous Date**, **Today**, and **Next Date** buttons or select a specific calendar date with the datepicker. In the **Reservations** section, a user can see all reservations for a given date. For each individual reservation, a user can navigate to the **Seat Reservation** and **Edit Reservation** pages as well as cancel that specific reservation by clicking the appropriate buttons.  In the **Tables** section, a user can see all tables in the restaurant. For each individual table, a user can unseat a table and finish the reservation assigned to it by clicking the **Finish** button.
